# Aaren
Non-official implementation(with parallel method) of Aaren ([A]ttention [a]s a [re]current neural [n]etwork) module from paper with same name.

Important notice: Right now parallel method CAN NOT be used for training, since autograd doesn't work on it. I have some ideas how to fix that, 
but it would require modifying the original mathematical framework, and then will be considered as a variation and completely different project. You can check my other repos,
it may be already out.
